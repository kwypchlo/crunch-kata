# Crunch Kata

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)

## Installing

* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

## Developing

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch: `npm start` (preferable)

### Testing

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`
